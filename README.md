# CIS194

To learn Haskell I work through [CIS 194 - Spring 2013](http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/) by Brent Yorgey, as recommended in https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell.

The author of the second link provides good reasons why he recommends this course here: http://bitemyapp.com/posts/2014-12-31-functional-education.html

Before, I have read [Learn You a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com/), which lacks practice problems, and that's why I follow CIS 194 course.

To check my solutions, I looked at https://github.com/bschwb/cis194-solutions for reference.
